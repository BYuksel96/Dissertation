Web App - Queue management system for first year programming students
Idea is to have a clean cut finish to the web app. Information transparency is also of importance in this web app.
Built to requirements acquired from both stakeholder's of this system.
Looking to build in a manor in which the web app is versatile so that anyone can use it for a support session and not just first year programming.
