Queue Management System for First Year Programming Support Sessions.

The program created, and found here, is a web app for managing the queue of requests made by students that need help in their programming support sessions. Intially the plan was to have a system that would just manage the requests made. However, as the project developed an intelligent queueing system was deemed more appropriate (i.e. storing details on things such as: type of help needed, severity of the issue, etc.).

Efforts have also been made to build this system in versatile way. This is so the system could not only be used in programming support sessions but also in other support sessions also. The program has been built to the requirements of both the client and the stkeholders directly impacted by this system. Things such as usability and transparency of information (in the right areas) were also important in the development of this system
